# Self-scaled optimization algorithms to enhance PINNs

This repository includes the implementation of the Self-scaled Quasi-Newton algorithms suggested in:
* [Unveiling the optimization process of Physics Informed Neural Networks: How accurate and competitive can PINNs be?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999124009045)

together with the numerous scripts corresponding to the examples discussed in the previous work, with numerous comments, in order to facilitate their use and modification.

# IMPORTANT
This repository contains modified versions of two scripts from the ‘optimize’ package within the Scipy library [scipy.optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html). Specifically, the scripts named ‘_optimize.py’ and ‘_minimize.py’ have been modified. The original codes can be found in [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/tree/main/scipy/optimize).
